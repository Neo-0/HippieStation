changes: 
  - rscadd: "Holopara Pocket Dimensions have been reworked!"
  - rscadd: "Instead of simply teleporting you back and forth between a dimension, it now summons a \"manifestation\" of that dimension."
  - rscadd: "Standing in the manifestation, and de-manifesting it, will result in you being teleported to the dimension. This only affects the summoner and their holoparas, and what/whoever they're pulling."
  - rscadd: "While the dimension is de-manifested, the holopara can move it around, and re-manifest it wherever they'd like."
  - tweak: "You will no longer crit inside the pocket dimension."
  - bugfix: "You can now heal while in godmode."
  - rscadd: "Ghosts (or the summoner) can now examine a holopara to see it's stats"
