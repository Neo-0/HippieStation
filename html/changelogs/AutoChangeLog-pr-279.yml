  - rscadd: "Dwarves are now a playable species. As of now, they require alcohol and CO2 to survive."
  - rscadd: "Everything is subject to change. Dwarves as a project is not even close to being done."
  - rscadd: "Carbonhell did literally everything. Dwarf did nothing and is just piggybacking."
  - admin: "Admins, since you're inevitably going to get ahelps about players wanting to play as a Dwarf for the round, you make someone a Dwarf by going to Change Outfit and selecting Dwarf. Don't use Species unless you want to kill them. Don't overdo it unless you enjoy having players adminhelp over suffocation."
  - server: "Please reconsider fullstripping Dwarves unless you want to give our admins a headache. They need that Co2 tank."
