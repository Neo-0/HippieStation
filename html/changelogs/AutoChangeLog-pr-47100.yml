changes: 
  - rscadd: "Dynamic now has a more threat based scaling of the individual solo antag modes, instead of only scaling amount of modes to threat. This should make for a somewhat less chaotic jumble of rulesets, with later picked ones supporting the initial one instead of overshadowing every time. Old style chaos still possible though."
  - admin: "Dynamic: Configs now work."
  - rscadd: "Dynamic: Second and third rulesets rolling now has a threat-based probability of rolling instead of always doing so."
  - bugfix: "Dynamic: Rulesets should now fire more consistently."
  - bugfix: "Dynamic: Round-ender rulesets now (properly) cant stack below 90 threat. Several bugs fixed."
  - bugfix: "Dynamic: Fixed bugs related to forcing normal rulesets."
  - tweak: "Dynamic: Revolutions will not end the round on a station win."
  - bugfix: "Dynamic: Revolution should now end properly."
  - bugfix: "Dynamic: Revolution will no longer make ineligible players revheads. Borgs, get back in line."
  - balance: "Dynamic: Wizard summon events/guns/magic disabled."
  - balance: "Dynamic: Blood cult ruleset is now 35 cost by default."
