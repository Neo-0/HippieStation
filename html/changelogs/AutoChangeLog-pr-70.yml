  - rscadd: "Added a new spell for thanos -- Tank Armor. It allows him to \"focus\" his armor on either ballistics, melee, or lasers. Crew, use a VARIETY of weapons!"
  - balance: "However, as a consequence, his normal armor is nerfed a bit."
  - imageadd: "Icons for shockwave and bullcharge"
  - bugfix: "You can no longer insta-crit thanos or the syndie stone holder by bullcharging into each other."
  - balance: "Gauntlet regen is now at 3/second, and syndie stone regen is at 5/s."
  - balance: "Gauntlet AND syndie stone regen are halved while in space."
  - balance: "If you leave Thanos in crit, to die, without bothering to finish him off... It may come back to bite you in the ass."
